# CNNs
Convolutional neural network
The project is composed of two parts:
   1.The code for forward and backpropagation through a network, and implement the necessary functions for training.
   2.Design and train a CNN to classify numbers from the MNIST dataset.

From the comparison among the development of loss function using different magnitude of LR, it can be proposed that using the LR about 0.05 can obtain about 96% accuracy after running 18000 iterations. With more iterations, the accuracy is expected to increase to some extent.
